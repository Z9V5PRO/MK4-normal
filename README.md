# Z9V5Pro-MK4-Klipper

Basic setting for new Z9V5PRO MK4


.
.

and Z8PM4Pro (same control board, If you change it a little, it will be possible to install it, I couldn't test it because I didn't own it.)

.
.
.

Here, only the contents of installing Klipper on the above printer are included.

Also, the details may be different, so please install it with more interest.

Almost does the desired operation.

It became a printer with more possibilities.

I am also a beginner, 

so if there is a problem during installation, please solve it by yourself.

Good ideas are shared.

Thank You!!
